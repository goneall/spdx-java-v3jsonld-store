# spdx-java-v3jsonld-store

Stores SPDX documents in SPDX version 3 compatible JSON-LD format.

This library utilizes the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface) extending the `ExtendedSpdxStore` which allows for utilizing any underlying store which implements the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface).

# Using the Library

This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the [SPDX Java Library](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library).

Create an instance of a store which implements the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface).  For example, the [InMemSpdxStore](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spdx/storage/simple/InMemSpdxStore.java) is a simple in-memory storage suitable for simple file serializations and deserializations.

Create an instance of `JsonLDStore(IModelStore baseStore, boolean pretty)` passing in the instance of a store created above along with the format.  If true, `pretty` will produce more human readable output including indents as well as license expressions rather than full model license details.

# Serializing and Deserializing

This library supports the `ISerializableModelStore` interface for serializing and deserializing files.

# Development Status

Still in development, somewhat unstable.
